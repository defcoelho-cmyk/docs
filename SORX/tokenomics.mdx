## Flywheel

Buybacks are rule-based and directly tied to protocol usage. A predefined portion of protocol fees is automatically allocated to market purchases of **\$SORX**. These purchases occur against the public market float and do not rely on discretionary decisions. Acquired tokens are either burned or redistributed through usage-based reward mechanisms, reinforcing a continuous flywheel between tool adoption and token demand.

<Info>
  All parameters governing fee splits and buyback execution are publicly documented and subject to on-chain verification.
