## Sale Structure

**Public Sale (ICO)**\
10% of total supply\
Tokens sold at a predefined price.\
100% unlocked at TGE.

**Token Sale Price**

\$0.005 per SORX.\
Fully diluted valuation at TGE: \$5,000,000.

**Hard Cap**\
The public sale is capped at \$750K.

**Soft Cap**\
The minimum amount required to fully execute the initial roadmap is \$350K.

**Use of Proceeds**\
Funds raised scale execution speed and scope but do not change the core protocol design.

Funds raised during the public sale are primarily allocated to development, infrastructure, security, and operational runway. Proceeds are not used to fund buybacks or provide price support.

## Flywheel

Buybacks are rule-based and directly tied to protocol usage. A predefined portion of protocol fees is automatically allocated to market purchases of **\$SORX**. These purchases occur against the public market and do not rely on discretionary decisions. Acquired tokens are either burned or redistributed through usage-based reward mechanisms, reinforcing a continuous flywheel between tool adoption and token demand.

<Info>
  All parameters governing fee splits and buyback execution are publicly documented and subject to on-chain verification.
