## How to create custom strats

A short, step-by-step guide to building your own strategies.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New Strategy">
    On strats tab, tap `"Create New Strategy"` button;
  </Step>
  <Step title="Strategy Name">
    Enter a strategy name;
  </Step>
  <Step title="Basic Parameters">
    Set basic parameters;

    | **Buy/Sell Slippage** | Defines how much price movement you allow during a trade.                          | Higher slippage increases the chance your order fills, but at a worse price.                                      |
    | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Buy/Sell Priority** | Controls how fast your transaction tries to go through.                            | Higher priority means faster confirmation but usually higher fees.                                                |
    | **Buy/Sell Bribe**    | An optional extra fee paid to validators to push your transaction ahead of others. | Helps your order fill faster in congested markets.                                                                |
    | **MEV Protection**    | Reduces the risk of bots manipulating your trade before it confirms.               | It helps prevent front-running, sandwich attacks, and other MEV tactics that can worsen your entry or exit price. |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Buy Parameters">
    Set buying parameters;

    | **Min Market Cap** | The lowest market cap a token must have for your strategy to buy it. | Helps you avoid extremely small or risky tokens.                           |
    | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Max Market Cap** | The highest market cap a token can have for your strategy to buy it. | Useful for targeting early plays and avoiding large, slower-moving tokens. |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sell Parameters">
    Set selling parameters;

    | **Stop Loss**   | Automatically sells your position if the price drops to a set percentage. | Helps limit your losses.                               |
    | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Take Profit** | Automatically sells your position when the price reaches a target gain.   | Locks in profits without needing to monitor the chart. |

    <Note>
      Setting multiple Take Profit levels lets you scale out gradually, locking in profits while still riding potential upside.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Sell Parameters">
    You can also activate **Trail Stop** for an advance strategy;

    | **Activate At (%)**                                                                                                                | **Price to Change (-%)**                                                                                                                       | **Amount to Sell (%)**                                                                                                    |
    | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | The percentage gain where the trailing stop system turns on. After this level is reached, the strat starts watching for pullbacks. | How much the price must pull back from the top for the sell to trigger. This defines the pullback level that activates a partial or full exit. | How much of your position to sell when that pullback level is hit. Useful for scaling out in steps as the price retraces. |

    <Note>
      You can set multiple Trail Stop levels to secure profits gradually as the price pulls back.
    </Note>
    <Tip>
      Trail Stop and Take Profit can be used together or on their own.
